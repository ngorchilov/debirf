.TH DEBIRF "1" "Dec 2011" "debirf 0.32" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
debirf \- build an initrd to boot a full Debian system entirely from RAM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B debirf <subcommand> [options] [args]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBdebirf\fP (DEBian on Initial Ram Filesystem) is a set of tools
designed to create and prepare a kernel and initial ram filesystem
that can run a full-blown Debian environment entirely from RAM.
.PP
\fBdebirf\fP has various subcommands (see \fBSUBCOMMANDS\fP) which act
on a specified debirf profile (see \fBPROFILES\fP).
.PP
The debirf system is outlined at:
.PP

.PD
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Make a stock debirf rescue image using the default settings:
.nf
 $ tar xzf /usr/share/doc/debirf/example-profiles/rescue.tgz
 $ debirf make rescue
.fi
.PP
Make a debirf rescue image, specifying the mirror and a local HTTP proxy:
.nf
 $ tar xzf /usr/share/doc/debirf/example-profiles/rescue.tgz
 $ DEBIRF_MIRROR=http://ftp.debian.org/debian http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:3128/ debirf make rescue
.fi
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
\fBdebirf\fP takes various subcommands:
.PD
.TP
.B make [options] PROFILE
Create a debirf system based on profile PROFILE.  This will create the
root for the profile, run all modules on the root, and then generate
the kernel image (see \fBKERNEL\fP) and debirf initramfs.  This
subcommand takes various options (see \fBOPTIONS\fP).
.TP
.B enter PROFILE
Chroot into root of profile PROFILE, with full profile environment.
.TP
.B makeiso PROFILE
Create a bootable CD-ROM image from the kernel and initramfs in
PROFILE.  This requires a bootloader to be available.  If
grub-mkrescue (in the grub-common package on debian) is available, it
will be used.  Otherwise, isolinux (from the syslinux-common package)
is used if it is available.  You may use the
\fBDEBIRF_ISO_BOOTLOADER\fP environment variable to specify a
preference manually (see below).
.TP
.B makedeb PROFILE
Create an installable Debian package from the kernel and initramfs in
PROFILE.  The created package will install the kernel and initramfs in
/boot/debirf, and will install an /etc/grub.d hook script which will
add a debirf grub boot target.
.TP
.B help
Output a brief usage summary.
.PD

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-root-build\fR

privileges or CAP_SYS_CHROOT)
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-no-warning\fR

.PD
.SH PROFILES
.PP
A debirf profile is a directory containing a debirf.conf config file
and a modules sub-directory (see \fBMODULES\fP).
.PD
.SH MODULES
.PP
\fBModules\fP are used to configure the debirf system, and can be used
to extend the capabilities of debirf.  Modules are bash shell scripts
that are executed in alpha-numeric order by \fBrun-parts\fP in a
chroot in the debirf root during the module stage of the debirf build.
The module stage is right after the debirf debootstrap stage, and
right before the initramfs archive is created.  All shell variables
beginning with "DEBIRF_", including those defined in the
\fIdebirf.conf\fP file, are available to the modules.
.PP
\fBNOTE:\fP Some modules are more important to the proper functioning
of debirf than others, and the ordering of modules is important.  Some
modules may depend on certain other modules having already been, or
not yet been, run.  For instance, the module that cleans the debirf
apt cache ("z1_clean_root") should be the last module run at the end
of the module stage.
.PD
.SH KERNEL
.PP
The \fBdebirf\fP "install-kernel" module will try to pick the most
up-to-date kernel for the suite you are installing (versions 2.6
only), with the arch determined by the kernel running on the host
build system.
.PP
.SH FUNCTIONS
.PP
A set of pre-defined bash shell functions are available to the modules to
fasciliate configuring the debirf system:
.PD 1
.TP
.B debirf_exec <command>
Execute <command> within debirf root (\fBDEBIRF_ROOT\fP) with chroot.
.TP
.B msg <message>
Output a message to standard out during the build process.
.TP
.B failure <message> <exit-code>
Cause debirf script to fail with <exit-code>, and <message> to stderr.
.TP
.B debirf_info_sh <message>
Write one line of sh code to the \fIdebirf.info\fP file on the debirf root.
.TP
.B debirf_info_comment <message>
Write one line of comment to the \fIdebirf.info\fP file on the debirf root.
.RE
.PD
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The following environment variables are used by debirf:
.PD 1
.TP
.B DEBIRF_LABEL
debirf label (default: debirf)
.TP
.B DEBIRF_BUILDD
where to build the debirf (default: ./)
.TP
.B DEBIRF_ARCH
architecture to build (default is the architecture of the build
machine)
.TP
.B DEBIRF_SUITE
suite to build from (default determined from lsb_release, otherwise "sid")
.TP
.B DEBIRF_DISTRO

.TP
.B DEBIRF_MIRROR
mirror to pull suite (default determined by DEBIRF_DISTRO)
.TP
.B DEBIRF_KEYRING
keyring to verify debootstrap (default determined by DEBIRF_DISTRO)
.TP
.B DEBIRF_KERNEL_FLAVOR
the flavor of kernel debirf should install.  Supply everything from a
typical debian package name after the version number.  e.g. 486,
vserver-686-bigmem, openvz-amd64. (default chosen based on
currently-running kernel)
.TP
.B DEBIRF_ISO_BOOTLOADER
whether to use "grub" or "isolinux" as the El Torito bootloader for
\fBdebirf makeiso\fR.  if not specified, "grub" is the default.
.PD
.SH FILES
.PD 1
.TP
$DEBIRF_PROFILE/debirf.conf
Debirf profile configuration file.  Contains values for the various
debirf environment variables (see \fBENVIRONMENT\fP).  Variables
specified in the debirf.conf override those specified on the command
line.
.TP
$DEBIRF_ROOT/etc/debirf/debirf.info
File that stores various information about the debirf build.  This is
a bash-sourceable file.

.SH "BUGS"
Debirf does not work as a non-privileged user across different
versions of libc.
.
In particular, this means that you probably won't be able to build an
image from a different version of the operating system than you're
using without building as root.
